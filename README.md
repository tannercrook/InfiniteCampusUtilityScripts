## Warning! Use at your own risk!

You use these scripts at your own risk understanding that by using them, you are taking full responsibility as the one issuing the command of the repurcussions. You are responsible to understand what the script does and all the outcomes regardless of what is documented in code comments. You understand that the authors of any code or scripts used are not liable for any outcome resulting from using materials in this repository.

## Contributing
------
I encourage everyone to contribute so this can become a repository of useful scripts. When building scripts to contribute, do your best to make the script universal by using variables and little to no hardcoded values. However, that being said we want you to share at all costs, so please make sure to properly document the script.

Also, please make sure that a similar or duplicate script does not exist prior to contributing a new one. Please make enhancements or add to existing script files.

## Thanks
------
I would like to thank anyone who is contributing in advance. I would also like to thank Infinite Campus for allowing customers to have the ability to use their product in a meaningful way. Not all SIS vendors allow you do access the database.
